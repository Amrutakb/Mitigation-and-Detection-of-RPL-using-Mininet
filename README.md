Introduction ðŸ“Œ
RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is designed for IoT and low-power wireless networks. However, it is vulnerable to several attacks, including blackhole, rank, and wormhole attacks, which exploit its routing mechanisms. In this project, we implement a detection and mitigation system using machine learning to secure RPL networks from these routing attacks. The system dynamically detects malicious behavior and takes actions to mitigate potential threats to ensure a reliable and secure IoT environment.

Motivation
IoT networks are highly susceptible to attacks due to their constrained resources and minimal security mechanisms. RPL is frequently targeted by attackers who exploit the protocolâ€™s structure to disrupt communications. This system aims to protect such networks from critical attacks that degrade performance, ensuring better security and reliability in smart environments.

Objectives
Simulate RPL attacks (e.g., rank, blackhole) using Contiki and Cooja.
Develop a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
Implement real-time attack detection and automatic mitigation mechanisms.
Evaluate the system using various IoT scenarios.

Literature Survey
RPL Attack Detection and Mitigation in IoT: This survey explores different approaches to detecting routing attacks in RPL, including machine learning-based IDS, feature selection methods, and various optimization algorithmsâ€‹(Literature survey).
Hybrid Deep Learning for RPL Security: Deep learning methods, such as GRU and LSTM, have proven effective in detecting multiple attack vectors like rank and blackhole attacks, offering scalable and adaptable solutions for IoT networksâ€‹(Literature survey).
Implemented System
We implemented a hybrid detection system using a machine learning model trained on network traffic data to detect rank and blackhole attacks. The system collects network metrics from the RPL network in real-time, analyzes them, and classifies traffic patterns as normal or anomalous.

System Design
The system is designed to operate in two phases:

Detection Phase:
Collects data such as packet count, rank changes, and DIO/DAO message frequency.
Uses a Random Forest classifier to detect abnormal behavior.
Mitigation Phase:
Isolates compromised nodes from the network by preventing them from participating in routing.
Implementation
To run the project:

Open the Cooja simulator.
Load the RPL network topology.
Run the attack scripts (attack_simulation.py).
Start the IDS with the following command:
bash
Copy code
python rpl_attack_detection.py
Testing
The system is tested against:

Rank Attacks: Malicious nodes advertise false rank information.
Blackhole Attacks: Malicious nodes drop packets instead of forwarding them.
Results & Discussion
Our system successfully identified and mitigated 95% of attacks in simulated environments with minimal overhead. Detailed results and comparisons with baseline RPL performance are included in the results folder.

Conclusion
The proposed system enhances RPL security by providing an efficient method for detecting and mitigating routing attacks in real-time. Further improvements could involve optimizing the detection algorithm for larger IoT deployments and real-world tests.
